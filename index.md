<p align="justify">This Project allows several forensic experts to have an orientation to perform formal processes that require the presentation of judicial and/or administrative procedures. In the first stage, criteria are agreed using current frames of work, such as ISO/IEC, NIST, UNE, among others. Furthermore, processes are generated in the area of mobile devices, groups of work, and communication devices.</p>

<p align="justify">The construction of this document implies the creation of a Good Practices and Formal Procedures Guide for the evidence treatment process. This project has been divided into four investigation processes. They are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>General Procedures</li>
  <li>Mobile</li>
  <li>Workstations</li>
  <li>Communication devices</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">Likewise, it is proposed the production of two kinds of forensic reports (executive and technical), as well as a chain of custody that contain the good practices. The Project leaders are Oscar Orellana, Oscar Bravo and Daniel Pacheco, who have performed and worked on several studies and contributions to the field of Cybersecurity.</p>
