This Project allows several forensic experts to have an orientation to perform formal processes that require the presentation of judicial and/or administrative
procedures. In the first stage, criteria are agreed using current frames of work, such as ISO/IEC, NIST, UNE, among others. Furthermore, processes are generated in
the area of mobile devices, groups of work, and communication devices.
The construction of this document implies the creation of a Good Practices and Formal Procedures Guide for the evidence treatment process. This project has been
divided into four investigation processes. They are:
  • General Procedures • Mobile
  • Groups of work
  • Communication devices
Likewise, it is proposed the production of two kinds of forensic reports (executive and technical), as well as a chain of custody that contain the good practices.
The Project leaders are Oscar Orellana, Oscar Bravo and Daniel Pacheco, who have performed and worked on several studies and contributions to the field of
Cybersecurity.
Oscar Orellana, master’s degree in Cybersecurity, holds several certifications in the field. He is currently working as a Cybersecurity engineer in the area of SOC
in banking companies and as a consultant of mobile apps analysis for banking companies in Japan. He is also a professor in different undergraduate programs
contributing to the training and further training of technicians and engineers. Oscar holds international certifications in the area such as; ISO/IEC27001:2013. As
a contribution to the field of cybersecurity we can mention the development of several talks in the field of Information Security for different countries: OWASP 24
hours and OWASP SENDAI, among others. His line of work in Forensic Analysis on mobile devices has been given an award in Spain and is currently used as academic
material.
Oscar Bravo, master’s degree in Cybersecurity, holds several certifications in the area, such as: CEH from EC-Council. He is currently working as an engineer in
cybersecurity in the field of pentesting for different companies in Chile. Oscar has given different talks in order to transmit his knowledge to others and help
them in the path of cybersecurity. As part of his forensic knowledge, we can mention his publication related to forensic procedures automation, explaining how
programing languages have contributed to the gathering of forensic evidence. This publication is available in the following online repository: https://www.imf

Daniel Pacheco holds a telecommunication engineering degree and a master’s degree in security, technical expertise and audit in computer processes. He is currently
working in
computer networks in banking in Chile. Furthermore, he has more than 15 years of experience in the training of students and teachers in the computer networking area
and he also holds an instructor trainer certification from Cisco Networking Academy. As part of his contribution to the cybersecurity community, we can mention the
development of a passive analysis tool for networking devices.
This document was translated and revised by Silvia Arias, who is part of the team for English language purposes. Silvia is an English language teacher and holds a
master’s degree in Linguistics. Currently, she is a teacher at the University of Santiago in Chile and is part of the Linguistics and Literature Department. Her
lectures include: Linguistic Paradigms, Systemic Functional Grammar, the Linguistic Landscape workshop and she is also thesis director. Silvia is also part of the
Organizing committee of CYBERSEC Chile, the International Cybersecurity Conference organized by the University of Santiago, Chile.
